# 8-Bit-Approximate-Multiplier-Design


This project implements an # Approximate 8x8 Multiplier using Low Error 4:2 approximate compressors and a custom-designed approximate 4-bit full adder. The architecture targets **error-tolerant applications** such as image processing, where reductions in power, area, and delay are more valuable than absolute accuracy.

The multiplier is structured in multiple reduction stages using a combination of **approximate compressors**, **approximate adders**, and **exact logic components**, optimized to minimize complexity while maintaining acceptable output quality.
